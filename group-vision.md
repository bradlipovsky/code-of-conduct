# Group Vision

## Overview
We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience, both professionally and personally. Accordingly, all members of the Ice & Climate Group (ICG) are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times. We create our culture and our culture is inclusive.

Please note that this is a documentation of our vision for group culture and goals, and is not a legal document, which supplements, but does not replace, School- and/or College-level policies for your level of employment or study.

## Cultivating a safe group culture
Enjoyable, high-quality research can only be conducted when you feel safe, secure, and supported. All group member are thus dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and/or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our group in any form, and we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct:

1. Be kind to others and do not insult or put down other group members.
2. All communication, be it online or in person, should be appropriate for a professional audience, and be considerate of people from different cultural backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
3. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Contribute to discussions in meetings with a constructive, positive approach
Be mindful of talking over others when discussing in groups, and be willing to hear out the ideas of others. Talking over others is disruptive and leads to unproductive meetings, but also it makes the person who is being talked over feel like their ideas are invalid or not worth being considered. To facilitate discussion and ensure that everyone is heard:
Wait for others to pause, or finish their train of thought before you being speaking or gesticulating, etc.
Please be sure to pause long enough between thoughts or explicitly invite others to respond when speaking so that others feel welcome to contribute to the discussion

In addition to making group members feel safe and secure, diversity and inclusivity has numerous benefits to us all. Put simply, the greater the mix of people in our group, the greater the mix of skills, experiences, perspectives, and ideas we can collectively draw on. But the benefits of diversity and equality cannot be fully achieved without creating an inclusive environment.

Alex will discuss these guidelines with group members who violate these rules, no matter how much they contribute to the ICG, or how specialised or needed their skill set. If inappropriate behaviour persists after this initial discussion, formal processes, in line with Georgia Tech policies, will commence. To report an issue, please contact Alex Robel; all communication will be treated as confidential. Please be advised that as a university employee, Alex is a mandated reporter, and must forward your complaints to the Title IX office if they indicate that sexual harassment or assault has taken place. If you do not feel comfortable contacting Alex directly, please feel free to contact a member of the Georgia Tech Title IX office (http://titleix.gatech.edu/).

## Commitment to Combat Racism and Discrimination

Our group does not exist in a vacuum, but is within and affected by the structures, rules and customs of broader systems, including academia, our scientific community, and our society. The unfortunate reality is that these systems have been and continue to be discriminatory, racist and sexist institutions, which perpetuate harmful actions towards black, indigenous, and people of color, in addition to women and LGBTQ+ people. It is because of this discrimination that these groups have been, and continue to be underrepresented in the research community.

As outlined in the rest of this document, it is the goal of the Ice & Climate Group to be an inclusive and safe place in which to do the best science and promote the happiness and career development of its members. However, cultivating such a group culture is not enough if it still exists within a system that is not equitable, diverse, and inclusive. As such, our group strives to promote anti-discriminatory and anti-racist values within our broader campus and scientific communities. We do so in our words, but also in our actions, by:
Actively recruiting group members (at all career stages) from historically underrepresented groups, and fostering a supportive community so that our group is a desirable and welcoming environment (see rest of guidelines). Our goal is for the Ice & Climate group (including undergraduate and graduate students) to be representative of the US population averaged over time scales of 5-10 years (to mitigate small number biases), and to review our efforts and shortcomings in this regard each year in the fall prior to the PhD application cycle.
To facilitate recruitment, we maintain active efforts to work with the many world-class minority-serving institutions in the Atlanta region, and the Southeast more broadly. We begin these recruitment efforts through an annual commitment to recruit and mentor at least one BIPOC student through the EAS REU program, and when possible, through interested GT undergraduate students.
Pursue strategies to combat the doubly-unrepresentative nature of mathematical, computational and dynamical glaciology, including maintaining a diverse range of entry points for potential projects and providing mentoring (ourselves or through institute resources) to group members in approaches and techniques that we consider integral to our research.
We commit to participating or leading outreach events in our community in K-12 schools and community organizations. This includes 3 outreach events per year (approx. one per semester), where at least two are directed towards communities underrepresented in glaciology, and at least one includes participation by more than half of ICG group members.
Pay or award credit to members of the Ice & Climate Group equitably within each career stage. This includes advocating for better pay and employment policies at the Institute level.
Actively supporting the efforts of underrepresented scholars outside of the Ice & Climate group by seeking a diverse and balanced pool of seminar speakers, conference presenters and co-conveners, research collaborators, and award nominees. Our goal is to have speakers nominated for GT seminars (EAS school seminars and ad-hoc visitors to Ice-T) be representative of the US population. To pursue this goal we will also look outside of glaciology and outside the US for potential speakers.
Using gender- and race-neutral language in recommendation letters and trainee evaluations (https://csw.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/avoiding_gender_bias_in_letter_of_reference_writing.pdf)
Recognizing that areas of potential research interest in the Arctic and high North (and where we live in Atlanta) are colonized Indigenous land, and using original Indigenous place names (e.g. for Greenlandic glaciers: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1449148) and land acknowledgements in published or presented work.
Holding those in power (including Alex and those in our own institution) and each other accountable by calling out racist, sexist, or otherwise hurtful language and actions. We support each other in this accountability. Conflicts within our own group should be adjudicated in private and with Alex’s assistance (or if preferred, through Institute resources: https://provost.gatech.edu/reporting-units/conflict-resolution-ombuds/contact).
Incorporate discussions of anti-racism and anti-discrimination efforts in the geosciences into our group discussion at least once a semester. Discuss further ways in which we can add to the above actions in our group efforts.
Remaining accountable to ourselves by reviewing our efforts in these directions each year, naming ways in which we have failed to live up to our own standards (specific goals are bolded in the above action items), and outlining steps to make changes in the coming year. 

## Mental Health
There is increasing evidence that certain attributes of PhD research may challenge your mental health. Specific factors driving this include:

Low pay and quality-of-life issues, particularly as a function of living in Atlanta
Feelings of isolation in your research; e.g. everyone has their own topic and it can often feel as if you are working on your own
Uncertainty in your research, although it should be noted that, in research of all kinds, it is not just the outcomes that are uncertain, but the questions themselves! 
Uncertainty in your post-PhD career
So-called “negative results”; i.e. at some point in your research it is likely that certain questions will be more challenging to answer than anticipated, or that you will feel you have spent days/months/years toiling with little to show
Burnout; i.e. feeling the need to work endless hours to make up for the above issues, and the subsequent exhaustion

All PhD students come across most of these issues at some level. I strongly encourage everyone in the group to take an active and pre-emptive approach towards the maintenance of their mental health. I assure you that you have the time and resources needed for a highly successful PhD. If there is anything that is placing undue stress, or preventing you from performing at your potential, please do not hesitate to let me or any of the postgraduate tutors in the department know how we can help. You should also be familiar resources on campus: http://counseling.gatech.edu/. Every effort will be made to help you access the right support networks.

## Group Identity vs. Individual Contribution
The purpose of having the “named” Ice & Climate Group is two-fold: (1) to support each other, (2) to promote our group to newcomers and potential newcomers. The purpose of the group is not to “brand” the ideas as group ideas, or Alex’s ideas. Your project is yours to make your own. You should not feel as though you are presenting Alex’s ideas or the group’s projects. For your career and for the development of the science, it is important for you to feel ownership of the project that you are working on. It is good to talk about “we” when it is us working together on developing the project, but you should take credit for ideas that you come up with in the course of your research. (That being said, you should always acknowledge project funders when presenting or writing a paper.)

## Outputs and open science
Authorship on any manuscript or presentation will be openly discussed in group meetings and should, if possible, include everyone who has made a significant contribution to the work. A “significant contribution” can include but is not limited to, interpretations of primary data and development of ideas presented in the work. The order of authors on a manuscript or presentation should be dictated by the relative contribution made by each author; in the case these contributions are equal, authors should be listed alphabetically by surname. Where conflict arises, Alex Robel will facilitate discussion to help resolve this. I encourage an open dialogue about this matter, ideally via authorship ‘check-ins’ that will likely occur several times over the lifetime of the study. To help inform Editors, reviewers, and readers of our papers, we will include an author contribution statement as part of a paper.
	
Your active research product (code, documents, etc.) should be backup up regularly using an off-site, ‘cloud’-based storage system. All Georgia Tech staff have access to a nearly-unlimited dropbox allocation.

All code written as a part of publicly-funded research and used to produce results or make plots in a published paper will be made publically available using GitHub or other public code repository. If you feel that there is a good reason for keeping your code exclusive, this should be discussed with Alex.

## Working hours
I recognise that many of you have personal responsibilities and obligations in addition to your PhD studies. I appreciate that, at times, it can be difficult to balance those demands, and that a classic ‘9-to-5’ day may not be optimal. Because of this, the exact hours you choose to work is up to you. Being on campus between 11 AM and 4 PM most days may, however, help facilitate collaborative working and, we hope, lead to a more fulfilling research experience. Where possible, meetings and events will not be arranged outside these hours to allow participation by all ICG members.

## Holidays
You are expected to take (at least) two weeks of time off per year, beyond normal institute holidays (e.g. federal holidays, fall/spring/winter breaks). I strongly encourage you take this time so you can relax, visit family and friends, and generally unwind from the rigours of PhD study. Although not a formal requirement, it is helpful to inform Alex in advance when you plan to take holidays or if you will not be present at Ice-T or other group meetings. 

Work on weekends is sometimes OK and/or necessary (especially before deadlines), but will likely lead to a drag on your overall productivity if it is a regular occurence. If you feel that you are having difficulty maintaining a healthy work-life balance, please talk to Alex.

## Meetings
Group meetings: Ice-T is the weekly ice-related research seminar that includes all of Alex and Winnie’s groups, and often others from other groups in EAS. All Ice & Climate group members are expected to attend if they are not otherwise engaged in other research-related activities (e.g. at conference, attending training or a lecture, etc). The ICG meeting is an excellent forum for updating colleagues on project progress, developing research skills, and widening our collective understanding. Group meetings provide a forum for:
Research updates
New and interesting papers
Old and important papers
Papers from other fields
Practice conference talks
Manuscript in prep figures/outlines
Fellowship applications/proposals
Essays/articles on being a good scientist, inclusion, creativity, science writing, etc.

As part of your professional training, you will be expected to lead a group discussion on a topic of your choice at least once per term (though in practice you should present more frequently than this). The group meeting should be a forum for open discussion, not a venue for one-on-one discussions about very technical research details (that is what one-on-one meetings are for!). Alex will recommend tabling a discussion if it is derailing the group.

Individual meetings: These will occur on an ad-hoc basis as personal situations require. These will give you an opportunity to discuss your progress and any administrative issues that you need addressed. You are encouraged to come fully prepared for individual meetings with questions or issues that you would like help with, or ideas for further work; in this way, discussions can be focused such that all concerns are addressed. Ideally, in a one-on-one meeting, we should discuss: (i) what were your plans from last meeting; (ii) work undertaken; (iii) issues arising; and (iv) a forward plan until the next meeting. Such reports are an important way to self-monitor your progress, as well as keeping your supervisor(s) informed of both positive and negative developments. 

If you are having trouble meetings deadlines that we have previously agreed upon, please do not work yourself an unhealthy amount to attempt to meet those deadlines. Please talk to Alex about why you are having trouble meeting the deadline, and we will discuss how you can potentially work more efficiently or set more reasonable deadlines.

The purpose of these meetings is not for you to only report on what went right. Often the most pressing issue is a roadblock in the research or a failure. This is not a bad thing! Alex is here to help you get through those roadblocks or find an alternate route to achieve your ultimate goal. Ideally, feedback should be a roughly proportional mix of recognizing successes and analyzing failures.

Please inform Alex of holidays or notable absences in advance. Permission for holiday is very rarely required, but please respect key deadlines within the calendar year and the fact we work in a research group. It is important to take holiday, respect weekends (or time in lieu) and establish a sustainable work-life balance. It is also important to respect the time and efforts of others, and the contribution of funders, and to note that effective working will improve the quality of your research. Where there are key time pressures, it is important to prioritise work. If you struggle with establishing a sustainable work life balance, please discuss this with Alex at an early stage.

Other Group Activities
Part of being a supportive group is getting to know each other as people in addition to colleagues. To facilitate this, the group will strive to have regular activities that don’t necessarily revolve around research. These include: weekly lunches, quarterly dinners (at Alex’s house, but maybe elsewhere too), hikes, and other outings.

## Individual Development Plans

An individual development plan is a worksheet that identifies your current strengths, and those which you would like to develop over the next semester or few years. Group members will fill one out early in working with Alex and then periodically revise it on an ad-hoc basis. The document is simply a way to pause, be thoughtful about your goals, and communicate those goals to Alex in a way that he can follow up on.


Communication
Please give consideration to the timing of the email with respect to what the recipient needs to do; for example, try not to send an email at after 5pm for something that is required for a 10am meeting the next day. Different people work or respond to emails at different times of the day or weekend, and as stated earlier in this documents, those hours will not be prescribed. That being said, no group members are required nor should feel obliged to reply to email outside of their typical work hours. However, prompt replies to emails, within work hours, is helpful. 

Journals
You should be familiar with recently published material relevant to your PhD project. Below are some academic journals that may be of interest:
Journal of Glaciology
The Cryosphere
Journal of Geophysical Research - Earth Surface
Geophysical Research Letters
Nature Geoscience
Nature
Science
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

Signing-up to ‘mail alerts’ from specific journals and more general publication ‘feeds’ (e.g. Google Scholar or Web of Science) are highly recommended; by doing this, you can be kept informed of newly published literature related to your studies.

## Conferences
Conferences and workshops are by far the best way to meet other researchers (important for developing collaborations in the long run), disseminate your research in a timely fashion and learn about what others are doing. For US-based researchers in glaciology, there are a few conferences, some regular and others less so that are valuable venues for making connections and presenting your work.
AGU Fall Meeting - annual (mid-December) typically in SF - THE huge meeting for Earth scientists in the US, 20k+attendees, but always lots of good cryosphere content
EGU General Assembly - annual (April/May) typically in Vienna - smaller European version of AGU (still 10k+ though), good way to meet European cryo community, which is larger than American community 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet Workshop - annual (Sep/Oct) - small workshop (<100 attendees), mostly US participants, great way for researchers starting out to meet big names in field and program managers from funding agencies
International Glaciological Society Symposia - typically 2-3 per year - topics vary greatly, but always focused on ice topics, usually one symposium per year is more general (i.e. ice and climate change), usually anywhere from 50-400 attendees depending on topic
AGU Ocean Sciences - even years (early spring) - AGU meeting focused on ocean topics, typically some ice/ocean sessions, still big - 5k+ attendees
SIAM/APS Meetings - applied math and physics meetings, typically large, but a good venue to talk about more technical/mathematical aspects of your work to people outside of glaciology

Thanks, and please enjoy your time in the ICG!
